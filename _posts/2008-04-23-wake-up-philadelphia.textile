And let me hear ya sing <br />
The Orange and the Black <br />
The Orange and the Black

Across the blue line we attack <br />
We are <br />
The Orange and the Black <br />
The Orange and the Black <br />

Re-load and shoot again <br />
We are <br />
The Orange and the Black <br />
The Orange and the Black <br />

And a 1-2-3 <br />
Let the hats go flying <br />
For a Flyers victory <br />
And a 4-5-6 <br />
Our bold battalion <br />
May they take us all the way <br />
Wake up Philadelphia <br />

Down my family it was passed <br />
We are <br />
The Orange and the Black <br />
The Orange and the Black <br />

Kick the boards and pound the glass <br />
We are <br />
The Orange and the Black <br />
The Orange and the Black <br />

And a 1-2-3 <br />
Let the hats go flying <br />
For a Flyers victory <br />
And a 4-5-6 <br />
Our bold battalion <br />
May they take us all the way <br />
Wake up Philadelphia <br />

And let me hear ya sing <br />
The Orange and the Black <br />
The Orange and the Black <br />
