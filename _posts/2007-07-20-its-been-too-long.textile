It's been a while since I last posted.  My youngest turned one and we have made several trips down the shore.  The Phillies lost number <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/phillies/20070715_Phillies_lose_No__10_000.html">10,000</a>, and I was lucky enough to attend.

Plus, in visiting <a href="http://www.last.fm">last.fm</a> for the first time in months, I discovered a cool new feature 
that lets you embed your music stations in your blog.  Cool new feature!  I was in an <a href="http://www.amywinehouse.co.uk/">Amy Winehouse</a> mood, so enjoy the station to the left, based on her type of eclectic music.
