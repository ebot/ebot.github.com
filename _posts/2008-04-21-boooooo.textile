Up 2-0 in the second and the Flyers decided to stop playing aggressively.  The Flyers were under the impression that the Caps had stopped playing, just like the Pistons against the Sixers last night.   Guess what?  They didn't and by the time the Flyers realized it, it was too late.  Four unanswered goals and they are heading back to D.C for a game seven that clearly favors the Capitals.  

This what Terry Murrary would call a "choking situation."  Ovachicken woke up tonight and the Caps have all the momentum heading into game seven.  I hope the Flyers surprise me and win tomorrow, although for some reason, thirty years of experience tells me that is unlikely.

LET'S GO FLYERS!  Winner takes all tomorrow.
