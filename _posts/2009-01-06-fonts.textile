Just got done watching the "helvetica":http://www.helveticafilm.com/ documentary and something resonated with me.  I only use four fonts in just about everything I do on a computer.  I have experimented with dozens, but I always seem to fall back to the same set that just look the best to me.  They break out into the following uses:

* For email/documentation I use "helvetica 10pt":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica or "verdana 10pt":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verdana.
* For programming I use "Bitstream Vera Sans Mono 10pt or 12pt":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitstream_Vera_Sans.
* For ascii tables or fixed width text in emails/docs I use "Courier New 10pt":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courier_(typeface)#Courier_New.

It would only be three, but when sending docs or emails to others (especially non programmers), no one has the Bitstream Vera Sans Mono font.
