The Flyers and Caps are heading back to Philly with the series even at one game a piece.  If not for a horrible third period, they could easily be up two games to none.  Marty collected his third shutout in last four games.  Ovechkin has been blanketed by the Flyers defense and the Capitals coach says he is overstaying his shifts.  Experts feel he is playing too much.

Hope these trends continue in Philly and that the Flyers physical game continues to wear down the caps.

Let's Go Flyers!  Vengeance!
