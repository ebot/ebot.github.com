Washington was flat out dominating in the third period, but big Marty Biron stood tall keeping all 6 of Washington's shots out of the net.  The Flyers regrouped during the break and came out on a mission.  A two on one was thwarted by a trip on Sami Kapanen.  The refs made good on another trip to Lupul a few minutes later.  The Flyers were buzzing around the net, but it seemed like nothing could get though.  You knew the refs would equalize the call late in the OT period.  It was do or die for the Flyers, because Ovachicken was flying out there tonight.  Then with ten or eleven seconds left, Joffrey Lupul! finds the rebound and backhands it home for a Game seven victory on Caps Ice.

And a a one, two, three, Let the hats go Flyin for a Flyer's Victory!
