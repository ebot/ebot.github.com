The Flyers take on the caps in pivotal game six, tonight ant the Wach.  The building will be pumped and Ovechicken will be feeling the full brunt of the Philly faithful.  A Flyers win ends the caps season and sets up a second round matchup with either Montreal or the Rangers.  A Flyers loss sends them back to D.C. for a game seven where anything can happen.

I anticipate the Flyers will come out pumped up.  The first ten minutes should be very intense.

LET'S GO FLYERS!!!!!!!!!!!
